jquery-platinum
===============

A jQuery utility library for building fast-loading, professional frontend code.

### Project goals

* Extend jQuery with expressive, useful utilities for arrays, objects and asynchronous operations
* Provide normalized APIs for common website requirements like Google Analytics and social sharing buttons
* Implement a build system to create custom, minified builds of the codebase tailored to specific needs

This is a work-in-progress. Currently, the project provides:

* Language utilities for managing function binding and argument currying
* Array utilities for functional-style iteration and functions for map, reduce, filter, etc.
* Basic asynchronous script-loading utilities using a light wrapper around `$.ajax()`
* A powerful API wrapping Google Analytics' asynchronous library
